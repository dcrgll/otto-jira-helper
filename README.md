# Otto - The Jira Helper

The "Otto - Jira Helper" Chrome extension allows users to quickly open Jira tickets by typing a specific command in the URL bar. Hereâ€™s how it works:

- Setup: Users need to add their Jira Base URL in the extension settings.
- Accessing Tickets: After setup, users can type 'otto' followed by the ticket number directly in the browser's URL bar to quickly navigate to that Jira ticket.
